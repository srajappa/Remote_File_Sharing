#### Project Description ####
Application was run on the servers of Department of Computer Science and Engineering at University at Buffalo. 
All these servers abstracted the nodes, which were a part of a Hybrid network. A single server was a must for any operations
among the nodes. Once a node is connected to the server, it can connect and exchange files between the other peers connected to the server.

#### Operations Supported ####
The current implementation supports the following operations:
Markup: * Display IP address.
        * Display active port.
        * Display the active connections list.
        * Connect with a system.
        * Terminate connection with a system.
        * Exit the application (console).
        * Upload file(s) to the system.
        * Help

#### Running the application ####
Clone this repo (or your own fork!) to your **home** directory (`/Users/username`).
```
$ cd ~
$ git clone https://github.com/srajappa/Remote_File_Sharing
```
Change into the directory and then run the myApp.
```
$ cd Remote_File_Sharing
$ ./myApp
```

#### Future updates ####
I have some plans to update the repo by adding new features like SYNC, CHAT options. Stay tuned !! :smile_cat:
